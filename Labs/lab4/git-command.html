		<h2>VERSION CONTROL</h2>
		<p>
			Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record
			changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. Use
			of Version Control System: A repository: It can be thought as a database
			of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots)
			of the project

		<fieldset>
			<legend>GIT CLONE</legend>
			<p>
				You can clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer to make it
				easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger
				commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from
				GitHub to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full
				copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time,
				including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can
				push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other
				people's changes from GitHub
			</p>
		</fieldset>
		<fieldset>
			<legend>GIT COMMIT</legend>
			<p>
				Git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your
				repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at
				specific times. You should make new commits often, based around logical
				units of change. Over time, commits should tell a story of the history
				of your repository and how it came to be the way that it currently is.
				Commits include lots of metadata in addition to the contents and
				message, like the author, timestamp, and more.
			</p>
		</fieldset>
		<fieldset>
			<legend>GIT PUSH</legend>
			<p>
				The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a
				remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local
				repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but
				whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports
				commits to remote branches. Remote branches are configured using the git
				remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution
				should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.
			</p>
		</fieldset>
		<fieldset>
			<legend>GIT PULL</legend>
			<p>
				The git pull command is one of the commands that are involved in the
				"syncing" process. These commands work on the remote branches that are
				configured with the git remote command. The commits are uploaded with
				git push and download with git fetch and git pull. After making changes
				in both cases, git merge is used to integrate changes.
