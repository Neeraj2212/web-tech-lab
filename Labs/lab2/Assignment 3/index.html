		<h1>Web Development</h1>

		<h2>HTML</h2>
		<p>
			HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create
			and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for
			web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it
			doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it
			makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft
			Word.When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and
			attributes) to mark up a website page.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p style="background-color: #ac4b1c; color: beige">
			Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design
			language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
			CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can
			control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between
			paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or
			colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different
			devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects. CSS is
			easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
			presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the
			markup languages HTML or XHTML.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
		<p>
			JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
			implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more
			than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
			displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
			graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is
			probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
			technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more
			detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
