		<h1>CSS Property Values</h1>
		<p>
			Every time you use a property, you must give it a value â€” and certain
			properties can only accept certain values. For example the "color"
			property, we need to use a color value. This could be a hex value, RGBA
			value, or even color keywords. Any of those values would work, however, if
			you used the word "gloomy" with this property, it would do nothing
			because, as descriptive as that word may be, it is not a recognized value
			in CSS.
		</p>
		<p>All CSS properties have values that they expect. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Border-color expects a color value.</li>
			<li>Border-size expects a sizing value, like pixels or percentages.</li>
			<li>
				Border styles expects one of the reserved styles used for this property,
				like "solid."
			</li>
		</ul>
